	abstract = {Opioid addiction constitutes a public health crisis in the United States and opioids cause the most drug overdose deaths in Americans. Yet, opioid addiction treatments have limited efficacy. To help address this problem, we used network-based machine learning techniques to integrate results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of opioid use disorder and problematic prescription opioid misuse with transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in opioid overdose victims. We identified 211 highly interrelated genes identified by GWAS or dysregulation in the dlPFC of individuals with opioid overdose victims that implicated the Akt, BDNF, and ERK pathways, identifying 414 drugs targeting 48 of these opioid addiction-associated genes. This included drugs used to treat other substance use disorders and antidepressant drugs. Our synthesis of multi-omics using a systems biology approach revealed key gene targets that could contribute to drug repurposing, genetics-informed addiction treatment, and future discovery.Competing Interest StatementHenry R.

All primary data from DNA methylation, GWAS summary statistics, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, LC/MS proteomics, and RNA-seq are from previously published manuscripts. GWAS summary statistics from the Million Veteran Program (Kember et al., 2022) are available on the NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) under accession phs001672. GWAS summary statistics from Deak et al., 2022 are publicly available at https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/gelernter/stats/. GWAS summary statistics from Gaddis et al., 2022 are available under dbGaP under accession phs000454.v1.p1.We used the top 10,000 SNPs from Sanchez-Roige et al., 2021 GWAS summary statistics, which are publicly available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8562028/bin/41380_2021_1335_MOESM2_ESM.xlsx. Previously published data from H3K27ac ChIP-seq is available under dbGaP accession number phs002724.v1.p1. Previously published DNA methylation data is available at GEO accession number GSE164822. Previously published LC/MS proteomics is available at the ProteomeXchange PRIDE repository under PXD025269.

All activities were approved by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Institutional Review Board. The demographics of subjects from which GWAS summary statistics were derived along with descriptions of Institutional Review Boards to approve these studies have been characterized in previous publications and all subjects provided informed consent. All postmortem brain tissue samples are exempt from human subjects research.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material, if applicable.Yes},
